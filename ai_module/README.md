üß† AI Integration Module
The project includes a dedicated ai_module demonstrating practical integration of large language models (LLMs) to enhance customer support analytics.

üîç Module Highlights
Prompt Engineering: Designed task-specific prompts to classify customer requests, summarize issues, and generate weekly insights.

Model Behavior Control: Tuned GPT system prompts, temperature, and other parameters for reliable outputs.

Model Comparison: Evaluated outputs from multiple models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and documented key differences.

Automation Script: Created a script (gpt_pipeline.py) to process new client messages via GPT and integrate with the reporting flow.
