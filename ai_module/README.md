# 🤖 AI Module for Customer Support Analytics

This module enhances the **Customer Support Analytics** project with Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify, summarize, and analyze customer support data using neural networks.

It demonstrates practical AI applications such as:

- 🔠 Zero-shot classification of customer requests
- 🧾 Generation of human-readable summaries for reports
- 🔍 Comparison of LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini
- ⚙️ Configurable prompts and temperature settings

## ⚙️ How It Works

The module loads a saved prompt and sends it to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) using OpenAI's API. It can:

- Classify customer requests by intent
- Interpret time-series forecasts
- Generate natural language summaries for weekly reports

All outputs can be included in the final report sent via Telegram (`send_report_bot.py`).

## 🔧 Configuring the LLM

Model settings are stored in `llm_config.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "system_prompt": "You are an assistant classifying support requests for a customer service department..."
}
```


#### 🔬 Model Comparison
See model_comparison.md for a qualitative analysis of LLM outputs:
| Prompt File              | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| prompt_classification.txt| Categorize user requests by topic            |
| prompt_forecast.txt      | Translate numeric forecasts into plain language |
| prompt_summary.txt       | Create a summary for a weekly support report |


Each model was tested on real prompts from this project. Differences in tone, structure, and accuracy are discussed.

# ✍️ Prompt Design
Prompts were tailored to the context of real client request data:

Prompt	Purpose
prompt_classification.txt	Categorize user requests by topic
prompt_forecast.txt	Translate numeric forecasts into plain language
prompt_summary.txt	Create a summary for a weekly support report

The design emphasizes clear task instructions and consistent formatting.

# 📄 Example Output
Here’s a real result generated by the LLM pipeline:

This output shows how the AI complements the traditional ML pipeline by generating readable summaries and insightful classifications.

# 🧩 Integration with Main Project
This module builds on the main pipeline by:

🔁 Enhancing or replacing TF-IDF + Naive Bayes classification

📈 Making time series output human-readable

🤖 Automating insights through prompt engineering

📬 Embedding outputs into final reports via send_report_bot.py

It’s fully modular — easily replaceable or extendable with new models or tasks.
